For students with time online classes get really boring  which leads to a decrease in their participation in classes. They have to be present during the classes for attendance and that’s why they can’t even focus on their own work or could study themselves.
This is a time when students can learn a lot of things but because of all these classes they end up being unproductive.

How can we solve this problem ?

By changing live classes to recorded sessions.

We have created a website for teachers as well as for students. All the teachers can record their lectures and put on the websites and students can access those recorded sessions anytime they want.Teachers can conduct tests on the website and send the links to student through that website only. 

Whats new in this?

Besides creating a classroom , we have also a feature to help students focus and work more efficiently.  You can play games , listen songs,  take small naps and monitor them  . You can also watch some memes and vines to relieve your stress.
In the future we will also love to add a feature for peers to connect together and discuss things regarding the recorded sessions or any doubts they have.
